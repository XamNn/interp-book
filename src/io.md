# IO

IO is implemented with some built-in functions.

## Standard Streams
- [Print](./Print.md) can be used to send text into standard out or standard error.
- [Input](./input.md) is used to get input from the user from standard in.

## File IO
- [WriteFile](./file.md) can be used to write text in to a file.
- [ReadFile](./file.md) can be used to read text from a file.
- [WriteBytes](./bytes.md) can be used to write bytes in to a file.
- [ReadBytes](./bytes.md) can be used to read bytes from a file.

## Process IO
- [Exec](./exec.md) can be used to execute a command.
