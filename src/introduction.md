# Interp, the Language

> Interp is currently in **beta testing**! Don't use it for production!

Interp is a procedural general-purpose dynamically typed interpreted scrpiting language.
Although it uses duck-typing, it also enforces type safety.
The interplang interpreter is coded entirely in Rust, and the language can be extended by dynamic foreign functions programmed in pure Rust. Functions in Interp are first-class-citizens and can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions. Interp supports both 64-bit integers as well as 64-bit floating point numbers. The record in Interp is a map of sorts, with keys and values, these can be of whatever type. There are no classes, It's not an object oriented language!
