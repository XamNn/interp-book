# Bool

Booleans are either `true` or `false`.

The most common use is the [If statement](./if.md).

```cs
if bool {
    Print("bool == true");
}
```

## Operations
Bools can be crafted with some operators.
```cs
a == b        # Equation
a != b        # Negative Equation
a | b         # Or
a & b         # And
a < b         # Less Than
a > b         # More than
a <= b        # Less Than or Equals
a >= b        # More Than or Equals
a is Type     # Fits into Type
a is not Type # Does not Fit into Type
```
